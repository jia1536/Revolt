# Revolt: Smart Farming using ML & DL 

## Project Description
"Revolt is an intelligent farming assistant that uses machine learning to recommend crops based on soil and environmental factors, and deep learning to detect plant diseases from leaf images, helping farmers increase yield and reduce losses."

##  Project Overview
Revolt is a smart farming assistant that:
- Recommends crops using ML models (XGBoost, SVM)
- Detects plant diseases using CNN-based DL models
- Suggests remedies using a local remedies database

## Features
- Crop recommendation using ML models (XGBoost, SVM)
- Plant disease detection using CNN-based DL models
- Remedies and treatments suggestions for detected diseases
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction

## Repository Structure
- `crop_analysis_and_prediction_.ipynb` - Crop recommendation model
- `crop_disease_prediction_end_to_end.ipynb` - Plant disease detection
- `Main_Ui.py` - Main UI interface
- `remedies.json` - Remedies for detected diseases

## Datasets
> Note: Datasets are taken from Kaggle to train the models  
- Crop dataset: [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varshitanalluri/crop-recommendation-dataset)  
- Disease dataset: [Plant Village Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease)
